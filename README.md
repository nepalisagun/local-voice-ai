  <h1>Local Voice Agent</h1>
  <p>A private, low-latency voice assistant that runs on your hardware.</p>
  <p>Powered by <a href="https://docs.livekit.io/agents?utm_source=local-voice-ai">LiveKit Agents</a>.</p>
</div>

Local Voice Agent combines speech recognition, a language model, and speech
generation in one supervised application. It selects a model stack that fits
the available hardware and memory.

> [!TIP]
> The Jetson profile supports real-time voice conversations on a Jetson Orin Nano.

The application includes:

- A browser voice interface.
- Local streaming speech recognition with Nemotron Q8.
- Local language models through llama.cpp.
- Local speech generation with Kokoro.
- Automatic setup for CPU, NVIDIA, Apple Silicon, and Jetson.
- A remote-client mode for devices that run without a local browser.

## Requirements

Clone this repository before you start:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShayneP/local-voice-ai.git
cd local-voice-ai
```

The setup launcher needs Python 3.10 or later.

Install the additional tools for your platform:

| Platform       | Requirement                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Linux CPU      | Docker Engine with Docker Compose                            |
| Desktop NVIDIA | Docker Engine, Docker Compose, and NVIDIA Container Toolkit  |
| Jetson Orin    | JetPack 6.2, L4T 36.4, and the NVIDIA Docker runtime         |
| Apple Silicon  | Python 3.11–3.13, `uv`, `livekit-server`, and `llama-server` |

On Apple Silicon, install the native server tools with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install livekit llama.cpp
uv sync --extra ml --extra dev
```

The first start needs an internet connection. Later starts reuse downloaded
model files and native components. Docker also reuses its image layers.

## Quick start

Start the setup launcher:

```bash
python3 run.py
```

The launcher shows the detected hardware, memory budget, and recommended
models. Accept the recommendation or select a different profile.

When the application is ready, open <http://localhost:8080>. When the browser
requests microphone access, permit it.

For a non-interactive start, run:

```bash
python3 run.py start --profile auto --yes
```

## Model profiles

Automatic selection uses the device type to select a runtime. It then uses the
memory budget to select a model profile.

| Profile           | Memory target | Language model | Context | Speech recognition | Voice       |
| ----------------- | ------------: | -------------- | ------: | ------------------ | ----------- |
| `lean`            |  About 4.7 GB | Qwen3 1.7B     |      4K | Nemotron Q8        | Kokoro ONNX |
| `jetson-realtime` |  About 4.7 GB | Qwen3 1.7B     |      4K | Nemotron Q8        | Kokoro ONNX |
| `compact`         |  About 5.5 GB | Gemma 4 E2B    |      4K | Nemotron Q8        | Kokoro      |
| `balanced`        |  About 6.5 GB | Gemma 4 E2B    |     16K | Nemotron Q8        | Kokoro      |

The memory values are planning targets, not hard limits. The automatic mode
keeps memory available for the operating system and active conversations.

All profiles use the native streaming Nemotron Q8 runtime. The launcher selects
the CPU, CUDA, or Metal runtime for the device.

The default language is English. For English, the application uses the
English-specific Nemotron model. For another supported language, it uses
Nemotron 3.5.

Set the language in `.env.local`:

```env
STT_LANGUAGE=fr-FR
```

If the speaker language can change, use `STT_LANGUAGE=auto`. This value selects
the multilingual model. Whisper remains available as a manual fallback:

```env
STT_PROVIDER=whisper
```

Whisper waits for a complete utterance before transcription. Nemotron sends
partial transcripts while the user speaks, so Nemotron has lower voice latency.

To set a memory budget, use `--memory-gb`:

```bash
python3 run.py start --profile auto --memory-gb 5.5 --yes
```

## Use a Jetson as the voice server

The recommended Jetson setup runs the voice stack on the Jetson and the browser
interface on a laptop. This gives the browser a `localhost` address for
microphone access.

The Jetson setup needs approximately 29 GB of free disk space. The first build
compiles native components, so it takes longer than later builds.

### 1. Configure the Jetson address

On the Jetson, find its LAN address:

```bash
ip -4 -brief address
```

Create `.env.local` in the repository root. Replace the example address with
the Jetson address:

```env
LIVEKIT_URL=ws://192.168.1.40:7880
LIVEKIT_NODE_IP=192.168.1.40
MANAGE_LIVEKIT=1
```

### 2. Permit local network traffic

The laptop needs these ports on the Jetson:

| Port   | Protocol | Use                           |
| ------ | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `8080` | TCP      | Connection details and status |
| `7880` | TCP      | LiveKit connection            |
| `7881` | TCP      | WebRTC fallback media         |
| `7882` | UDP      | WebRTC media                  |

If UFW is active, permit only the local subnet. Replace the example subnet with
your local subnet:

```bash
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw allow proto tcp from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 7880,7881,8080 comment 'local voice ai'
sudo ufw allow proto udp from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 7882 comment 'local voice ai media'
```

CAUTION: Do not expose these ports to the public internet. The default service
uses development credentials.

### 3. Start the Jetson

```bash
python3 run.py start --profile auto --memory-gb 5.5 --yes
```

Wait until the launcher reports that all services are ready.

### 4. Start the laptop client

Install Node.js 20 on the laptop. Then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShayneP/local-voice-ai.git
cd local-voice-ai
corepack enable
python3 run.py client --server 192.168.1.40
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. The client installs its frontend packages on the
first start.

## Common commands

| Command                                 | Purpose                               |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `python3 run.py`                        | Configure and start the application   |
| `python3 run.py configure`              | Select a different profile            |
| `python3 run.py plan`                   | Show the selected runtime and models  |
| `python3 run.py status`                 | Show service readiness                |
| `python3 run.py logs`                   | Follow the application logs           |
| `python3 run.py down`                   | Stop the Docker application           |
| `python3 run.py client --server <host>` | Run the interface for a remote server |

The launcher saves the selected profile in `.local-voice-ai.toml`. This file is
local to the device and is not committed to Git.

## Configuration

Put device-specific configuration in `.env.local`. This file overrides the
selected profile and the defaults in `.env`.

Common values include:

| Value             | Purpose                                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `LIVEKIT_URL`     | LiveKit server address                             |
| `LIVEKIT_NODE_IP` | LAN address advertised by a managed LiveKit server |
| `LLAMA_MODEL`     | Model name used by the agent                       |
| `LLAMA_HF_REPO`   | GGUF model repository and quantization             |
| `STT_PROVIDER`    | Speech engine. The default is `nemotron-cpp`       |
| `STT_LANGUAGE`    | Speech language. The default is `en`               |
| `TTS_VOICE`       | Kokoro voice name                                  |
| `WAKE_WORD=1`     | Require “Hey LiveKit” before the agent listens     |
| `WEB_PORT`        | Browser interface port. The default is `8080`      |

See [`.env`](./.env) for the complete list.

### Use an external service

Set a remote base URL to replace one local service. The supervisor does not
start the matching local process.

| Service            | Configuration                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| LiveKit Cloud      | `LIVEKIT_URL`, `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` |
| Language model     | `LLAMA_BASE_URL`, `LLAMA_MODEL`, `LLAMA_API_KEY`       |
| Speech recognition | `STT_BASE_URL`, `STT_MODEL`, `STT_API_KEY`             |
| Speech generation  | `TTS_BASE_URL`, `TTS_API_KEY`                          |

Store API keys in `.env.local`. Do not commit this file.

## Troubleshooting

### A model shows several gigabytes during startup

The startup value is the model cache size on disk. It is not the memory used by
the process.

### The laptop cannot connect to the Jetson

From the laptop, request the Jetson status:

```bash
curl -fsS http://192.168.1.40:8080/api/status | python3 -m json.tool
```

If this command times out, make sure that the firewall permits the laptop
subnet.

### The interface connects without audio

Make sure that UDP port `7882` is open between the laptop and the Jetson.

### A service does not become ready

Show the current status and logs:

```bash
python3 run.py status
python3 run.py logs
```

## Local development

Local development needs Python 3.11–3.13, `uv`, Node.js 20, pnpm,
`livekit-server`, and `llama-server`.

Install the Python environment:

```bash
uv sync --extra ml --extra dev
.venv/bin/python -m local_voice_ai.agent download-files
```

Start the application:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m local_voice_ai serve
```

If you change the frontend, start its development server in another terminal:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm --dir frontend install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir frontend dev
```

Run the automated tests:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
pnpm --dir frontend build
```

## Security

The default configuration is for local development and trusted private
networks. It does not provide authentication for local model endpoints.

- Keep `.env.local` out of Git.
- Limit firewall rules to the local subnet.
- Do not publish the LiveKit or model ports directly to the internet.
- Use authentication and TLS before you expose the application through a
  public service.
